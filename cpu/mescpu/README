In order to build the CPU you must first create a dummy
`bin/symbols.inc` (`touch bin/symbos.inc`).  Then you need to compile
using `make mescpu.elf`, finally run `make bin/symbols.inc`.  Now you
can flash it with `make flash` or simply build it using `make mescpu.bin`.

If you don't want any game preloaded use `make remove-game` to remove
the game.
