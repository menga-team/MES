1. Clock used for timing. May be supplied from CPU or intern.

2. Counter used for counting from 0 to 17. the 18 combinations are used as instructions for the rest of the circuit. it is also hooked up to a flip flop wich takes as input the first bit of the counters oputput. when the counter is at a even number it disables the counter for the duratiopn of one clock cycle. More about that below.

3. logic gate used to recognise the number 18 in binary and reset the counter upon finding it.

4. The output of this and gate determins wether the counter is currently skipping a clock cycle. 

5. this line of and gates is used to interpret the individual bytes.

6. here we get a series of inputs corresponding to the currently selected button and a array of switches representing the actual buttons. If the selected button and the actual button outputs are 1 the output is 1 else 0.

7. before feeding the output of the bit interpretation we check if the counters current number is odd. only then the output is set to 1.

8. this is the final step before the aux port. we set the output to high if any of the bit interpretation, the sync sequence or the counter is skipping a cycle are high
